# Weather-test

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install

npm run dev
```

### Describe

Weather application implemented by using Vue and Vuex. Set weather by searching city, include 3 blocks:
1 block - show current weather
2 block - show 5 days weather
3 block - show todays weather in different hours in chart
By default set weather in your current location by using geo api

During work was some troubles with autocomplete because i couldnt find perfect api for cities, and used instead json file with list of more than 100k cities. Program works slowly

```sh
